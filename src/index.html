      <h3><blockquote>Childhood Years</blockquote></h3>
      <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Childhood is often described as a time of happiness and innocence; it was a mixture of emotions for me.<sup>1</sup> Looking back at my childhood, I think that my only concerns were picking a suitable crayon color for my drawings or figuring out how to trace an alphabet letter correctly.<sup>2</sup> As a child, I would convince myself that I was capable of superpowers, similar to those in movies or TV shows.<sup>3</sup> I also remembered that time my favorite movie was Superman since I also had the curly hair thingy in my bangs like him.<sup>4</sup> Every vacation, I look forward to going to our province in Bicol.<sup>5</sup> I'm always excited when we go because that's when our aunts and uncles from abroad come home, so I and my cousin get a lot of gifts.<sup>6</sup> My favorite part about it was that every street could be my playground because we live in a community where you can feel safe around every corner.<sup>7</sup> My childhood friends were my companions in discovering the world one small step at a time.<sup>8</sup> Whether it was learning to ride a bike, starting to use a computer, or getting scolded for staying out too late because we were playing hide and seek, every moment shaped me into the person I am today.<sup>9</sup> One of the most memorable moments of my childhood happened when I was around eight years old.<sup>10</sup> One afternoon, I just woke up from a nap, and I noticed in my peripheral vision that a woman in white passed by my side.<sup>11</sup> Out of curiosity, I followed her and noticed it was Grandma, who was surrounded by white light and wearing a white dress.<sup>12</sup> My parents rushed into the room, both anxious, and I started crying because I knew what it meant.<sup>13</sup> They asked me what happened so I told them what I saw.<sup>14</sup> My aunt then from my mother's side called and informed us that my grandmother had passed away.<sup>15</sup> She was my favorite grandmother because she always gave me everything I wanted, that's why at a young age I became aware of how important it is to spend time with the people we love.<sup>16</sup> From that day on, I learned two important lessons: Life moves quickly, and no one stays the same forever.<sup>17</sup> Instead of taking moments for granted, it's important to be present, appreciate the little things, and create lasting memories with loved ones.<sup>18</sup> And life is unpredictable, it's important to express our love and gratitude while we can, whether it be with simple acts of kindness, nice words, or just being there for them when they need us.<sup>19</sup> Even now, I cherish my early years because I know they laid the groundwork for my aspirations, determination, and never-ending curiosity about the world.<sup>20</sup>

        <h3><blockquote>Teenage Years</blockquote></h3>
        <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Teenage years start from high school as a time of forming strong friendships and experiencing personal growth.<sup>1</sup> However, not everyone has a permanent circle of friends during this stage.<sup>2</sup> I experienced having friends for a short time and then losing them due to misunderstandings.<sup>3</sup> I always end up finding myself drifting between different groups but never fully belonging to one.<sup>4</sup> One day, I just woke up having this feeling of isolation, but it also allows me to be independent and to have self-reflection.<sup>5</sup> Without a permanent friend group, I learned to adapt and interact with different persons with different personalities.<sup>6</sup> Apart from managing friendships, I also learned a lot from a long-distance relationship I had as a teenager.<sup>7</sup> For example, I was able to deceive my parents.<sup>8</sup> Thankfully, despite the emotional challenges brought on by physical distance, it also makes me more patient, dedicated, and appreciative of little interactions.<sup>9</sup> While in school, social demands and academic stress make my teenage years more difficult, and growing up in a broken family adds an even higher mental burden.<sup>10</sup> The absence of one of my parents created an environment where it feels like there is no safe space for me to express my feelings.<sup>11</sup> Since my mother had to take full responsibility for my needs at the time and her income was not very high, I also had financial challenges with my school fees.<sup>12</sup> Furthermore, because my mother was in Dubai and my father and I are not very close, I also lack parental guidance, which has had an impact on my emotional stability and decision-making.<sup>13</sup> I reached the point where I lost interest in studying because I don’t have strong support system.<sup>14</sup> The feeling of not having a complete family often leads to isolation, insecurity, and the struggle of having to mature faster than others.<sup>15</sup> One of my most painful experiences of growing up in a broken family is dealing with special occasions.<sup>16</sup> Birthdays, holidays, and school achievements often feel incomplete when one of my parents is missing.<sup>17</sup> While others excitedly plan family trips or celebrate with both parents present, teenagers from broken homes sometimes spend these moments feeling lonely, wondering what it would be like to have a normal, happy family.<sup>18</sup> Seeing my classmates with supportive, intact families can bring feelings of envy and sadness, making it difficult to truly enjoy those special days.<sup>19</sup> Despite these struggles, growing up in a broken family teaches me resilience.<sup>20</sup>

          <h3><blockquote>College Years</blockquote></h3>
          <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          College is believed to be the best years of a person's life since it is a time for building long-lasting relationships, exploring new opportunities, and achieving freedom.<sup>1</sup> But the situation is different for certain students, like me.<sup>2</sup> Like my experience, I don't have a permanent circle or friends to be with; that’s why my time in school feels depressing.<sup>3</sup> Instead of genuine laughs and meaningful friendships, each day is spent in quiet routines.<sup>4</sup> I see others effortlessly form groups, attend events together, and build strong support systems.<sup>5</sup> I found myself choosing to be alone and just go home after school.<sup>6</sup> I spent time alone during lunch breaks scrolling through my phone or pretending to be busy with assignments.<sup>7</sup> I wasn't completely alone, I had classmates to talk to, but I also didn't feel like I belonged to any permanent group.<sup>8</sup> Also, I don’t want to be connected with anyone else, because for me you should not trust anyone easily, because I always see a circle of friends backstabbing each other behind their backs.<sup>9</sup> Besides academics, my college life is full of threw away opportunities.<sup>10</sup> Seeing students post about their gala, made me worry if I was missing out on something important of college life.<sup>11</sup> While I wanted to join clubs or any particular activities, I was always afraid to go alone.<sup>12</sup> My partner was my classmate last semester, having a partner as a classmate means always having someone to sit with, work on projects together, and rely on for motivation.<sup>13</sup> But he suddenly stops studying, adjusting to the sudden absence of my partner in everyday college life is one of the hardest parts of this experience.<sup>14</sup> Aside from the emotional struggle, there is the problem of keeping motivated.<sup>15</sup> Before, studying seemed more manageable because someone was continuously pushing you to do better.<sup>16</sup> Whether it was pulling all-nighters together, reminding each other of deadlines, or simply being there for emotional support, having someone by your side made everything a little simpler.<sup>17</sup> Social interactions also become more complicated.<sup>18</sup> Most of my college life revolved around my partner, his absence makes me feel disconnected from others.<sup>19</sup> I realized that I don’t have a stable group of friends because I was always with my partner.<sup>20</sup>
